            <h1>Trade Shows</h1>
            <p>At Viscious Cylces we hold Trade Shows several times a year. Our inhouse trade shows essentially is a buy-back event, even if not purchased directly from us. Money is issued a instore credit. In order to be considered for a buy back, bikes must be in good condition and in a repairable state. Money can put toward upgrading to your dream bike. These trade shows are crucial in allowing Vicious Cycles the oppertunity to provide quality bikes to customers with all financial needs.</p><br>
