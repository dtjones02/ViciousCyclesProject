            <h1>About Us Heading1</h1>
            <p>Vicious Cycles Inc was established by local bike euthusiasts in late 2010. Our staff has over 10 years of dedication to the industry and helping customers find and maintain their dream bike. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the repair workshop. They have a passion to help cusotmers design and build the perfect bike for their needs. Our customer service staff attends the daily operations of the company. At Vicious Cycles, we strive to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene.</p>
            <p>We believe that every bike should be an extension of its owner. We believe, like in humans, all bikes are created to show individuality. We believe bikes allow us the oppertunity to escape the hussel of the busy world and get out and create memories in nature. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.</p>
            <p>Life is like riding a bike; everything is going smooth, you fall down, and have to get back up and keep pedaling. It's a Vicious Cylcle! Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.</p>
